PROBLEM SET

John is a thriving Company X agent and owner of Tapir Grocer, an artisanal grocery shop in Community Y. 
After the recent pandemic event, contact tracing has become essential and many apps have been developed for this. 
Instead of relying on these solutions, John decided to hire you to build a custom solution for Tapir Grocer.

A. Government requirements

The app you build for John must comply with the following government requirements:
•	Visitors can check in when visiting Tapir Grocer.
•	When they check in, the app will capture the visitor's full name, NRIC number, body temperature, date, and time.

B. Product owner requirements

However, John sees this as a business opportunity to make the app available to his friends and community. 
For this, the app should also have these features:
•	Location owners can sign up with the app and generate a link to display to their visitors.
•	When visitors visit this link, they can check in per the requirements in A.

C. Extra credits

The app is now complete and usable, but John wants the best experience for his visitors. It would be nice if the app can improve the visitor experience, for example:
•	Instead of typing the URL into their browser, visitors can quickly open the check in link.
•	After checking in for the first time, visitors no longer need to fill up the same details and can check in even more quickly.
